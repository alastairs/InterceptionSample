# InterceptionSample

A small sample demonstrating the use of static and dynamic interception as a way of applying Aspect-Oriented Programming techniques.  I am using my IoC container of choice, [Ninject](http://www.github.com/ninject/ninject/), and the [Interception Extension](http://www.github.com/ninject/ninject.extensions.interception/).  I chose the LinFu implementation of this extension arbitrarily.
